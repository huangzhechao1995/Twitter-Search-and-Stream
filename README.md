# Twitter-Search-and-Stream

This repo contains the code to script tweets using various APIs provided by Twitter.  

### Dependencies
**Python** Python 2
Package: **Twython**

### File structure
- Helper.py: It contains the key funtionalities that scrape data from Twitter calling Twitter's API  
- search-Andrew.py: It calls the functions in Helper.py to perform the two main tasks in this project  
    - (1) To Search for all the tweets that contain a specific "keyword within a certain timeframe (the hasttag model)
    - (2) To download all the past tweets in a user's timeline (The timeline mode)
- stream.py: (currently not used in the project), running this code, it could get the most recent posts of users as live streams
 
### Credentials
A twitter developer credential is needed to run the code.  
My personal credential is stored in `credential1.txt` and `credential2.txt`. They can be used to test the code.  
Yet I strongly recommend to apply for new ones for the purpose of future research.
